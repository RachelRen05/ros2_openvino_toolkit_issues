# Issues and solution
- run sample with IntelÂ® Neural Compute Stick 2. OpenVINO binary R4 + opencv v3.4.2
```bash
E: [ncAPI] [         0] ncDeviceOpen:668	failed to find device
#or
E: [ncAPI] [         0] ncDeviceCreate:324      global mutex initialization failed
```
- solution
```bash
reboot
```
- gtk conflict error
```bash
Gtk-ERROR **: GTK+ 2.x symbols detected. Using GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported
```
I have tried to use ldd to show the runtime usage of libs in my exes.
```bash

From the above results, we can see why there is a gtk conflict error. OpenVINO R4 integrated opencv v4.0 depends on gtk+2.x, but opencv v3.4.2 depends on gtk+3.0
- solution
Nedd to modify CMake to specify opencv v3.4.2
```bash
set(OpenCV_DIR $HOME/code/opencv/build)
```

```bash
intel@intel-desktop:~/ros2_overlay_ws/install/dynamic_vino_sample/lib/dynamic_vino_sample$ ldd pipeline_with_params | grep opencv
